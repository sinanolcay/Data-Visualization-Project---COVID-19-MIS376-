# Data-Visualization-Project-COVID-19-MIS376
The problem I chose is the increase in the unemployment rate during the covid 19 period. First of all, I will try to explain the increase in unemployment in Turkey and the whole world with some data and the poverty that comes with it. I will talk about my uncle as an example on this subject. My uncle owns a shop that sells baby products and I can say he is unemployed with covid.

The data I will need for my project are explanatory graphs created as a result of previous analyzes. According to my research, there are many data on this subject and the comparison of these data has been made over the years. Also,  I can find research results on the websites of some institutions.
