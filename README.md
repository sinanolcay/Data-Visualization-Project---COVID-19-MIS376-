# Increase in the Unemployment Rate During the Covid 19 Period


## Problem Description

As a result of the first case of the Covid-19 outbreak that occurred in China on December 1, 2019 in Turkey as of March 10, 2019, it has shown its effects in many areas in economic, social and political terms. Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 epidemic, which affects almost every field, has deeply affected the labor markets. The coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis has resulted in an unprecedented labor market shock and unemployment crisis. During the epidemic, risks and factors such as losing your job, shortening working hours, flexible working, and unpaid leave were encountered in the labor market. In addition, while working from home was only possible for certain professions and business lines before the pandemic, a significant part of the workforce started to work from home or part time in the Covid-19 period.

Some sectors of the economy were more affected than others during the Covid-19 process. For example, the hospitality and food sectors are severely affected by social distance restrictions, while the professional services sector is less affected as it is relatively suitable for teleworking. On the other hand, the wholesale and retail sector was the most affected during the quarantine periods. Retail trade (excluding motor vehicles) is the most affected sector, accounting for one-fifth of total workers leaving or firing. Food and beverage service activities followed the wholesale and retail sector, accounting for only 3% of total employment. On the other hand, retailers selling essential goods such as supermarkets and pharmacies continued their activities.

As a result, the unemployment problem has become one of the most important problems of the country in a short time. I have seen and watched many people desperately lost their jobs during the pandemic period. This is a big problem that should be paid attention not only to some sectors but also to all of Turkey.


## Unemployment!

When I think of a problem with Covid 19, the first thing that comes to my mind is unemployment. Because too many people around me had to stay at home unemployed during the pandemic. Therefore, in this project, I wanted to examine the level of unemployment in Turkey in general during the pandemic period and also important places in the world. We must care about this problem and find out what size it is.


## The Story of Problem About Unemployment

As I said before, during the covid 19 period, there were many people around me who were unemployed. I would like to talk about what they did during this period. My uncle owns a place where he produces special products for children. With the pandemic period, his business came to a standstill and he had to borrow a lot. Many people, like my uncle, were unemployed in the same way, and now these unemployed people all have debt. We have to see how great this issue has now become and the right decisions must be made for the lives of these people.
B Required Datas and The Challenges I Faced with Datas

As in every subject, we need some data to find out the unemployment rate during the pandemic period. I wanted to conclude my project correctly by comparing the number of cases and unemployment rates with these data. However, as a result of my long research I could not find an accurate and reliable source. Of course, I found certain charts made before, but I don't have a reliable data set on unemployment that I could create myself. I also thought that as a result of the strategy that Turkey had during the pandemic period, the rate of unemployment and the rate of the number of cases would be related. Because, while people could go to work in provinces with a low number of cases, workplaces were not open in provinces with a high number of cases and there was a curfew. As a result, at the end of my research, I decided that the most accurate data on unemployment would be the number of cases.


## The visualization tool I use?

While visualizing the data, I used the **'Datawrapper'** tool. Datawrapper, which is an easy-to-use and successful tool, enabled me to obtain a successful graphic during the visualization phase.
