# Data-Visualization-Project---COVID-19-MIS376
The problem I chose is the increase in the unemployment rate during the covid 19 period. First of all, I will try to explain the increase in unemployment in Turkey and the whole world with some data and the poverty that comes with it. I will talk about my uncle on this subject. My uncle owns a shop that sells baby products and I can say he is unemployed with covid.
